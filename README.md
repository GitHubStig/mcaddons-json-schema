# mcaddons-json-schema
## JSON schema(s) for Minecraft addons server/behavior files

Started out as an project to help my son with [Addons](https://minecraft.net/en/addons/) that was recently available in [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) Pocket Edition since version v0.16.0

I have been coding at work using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and it has auto-complete for various JSON file formats and it turns out it uses [JSON schemas](https://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/) to achieve that.

To set up [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to use the schemas provided, click [here](
